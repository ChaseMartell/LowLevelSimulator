# LowLevelSimulator

In this repo is a project that my group worked on for our Software Engineering course. We created a low-level simulator, and learned a lot of important skills that are necessary for success out in real jobs. We performed an Agile approach for the project, and held SCRUM meetings throughout several weeks.</br></br>

Other than the code, we had to add documentation for different aspects of the simulator. We had to talk through functional requirements that we wanted our simulator to contain, and we had 4 periods where we would submit our projects and receive feedback from the customer(A.k.a our professor). This allowed us to simulate receiving feedback on our simulator and performing maintenance and add improvements.</br></br>

The other individuals who worked on this project were Tanner Erekson, Derrek Buttars, and Matthew Palmer. Some of them did different things for our group than I did. I contributed around 80% of the overall code, so that is why I chose to include it in my portfolio, while they completed more of the documentation and other aspects of our projects.</br></br>
